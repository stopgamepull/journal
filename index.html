Maybe your parents were too strict, maybe they weren't. Maybe they teach you the wrong things or maybe you took the wrong path.

The fact is, you don't chose yet. Then you have take the strength and choose to go on left or right. Or maybe, not chosing at all.

Maybe you needed more love from them, maybe they were too protective. Maybe they left you alone. Maybe you just needed to communicate.

Working in progress...<br>
As a human being, we're in constant evolution. We learn things.<br>
From our past, we experienced moments and we create memories.<br>
What if you forget them all ? As human beings, we have fears.<br>
Imagine waking up in the morning and having no idea of who you are, who you were and who you will become.<br>
It's a silly questionnement that make me feel like I have the urge to write my thoughts, ideas, memories. Of course, not <i>secrets.</i><br>
It's time to forgive yourself, and it's time to change.<br>
Introspect yourself.<br>
Study your feelings, look deep within you for your motivations.

<button class="collapsible-blk">- Passion & suffering -</button>
<div class="content-blk">
<p>
Having interests is an essential condition to achieve happiness.<br> 

Being able to appreciate something so much that it is producing imbalance, this is what we call : passion.<br>
Actually the etymology of the word " passion " from the greek πάθος (pathos) meaning "suffering", "torture", the "state of the one who undergoes", designates all the instinctive, emotional and primitive drives of the human being which hinder his ability to think and act rationally.<br>
This explains the extreme side of enjoying something. Of course, you have to find the golden mean, the balance between what you consider is "good" and what is "bad".<br>
Loving something doesn't have to make us suffer. Quite the contrary.<br>
I found a book on the streets. It's a french synonym words book. I checked the word " passion " ... passion > dévouement > offrande > sacrifice > don / present > ...<br>
it's interesting, to notice that a word can mean the total opposite. The meaning of a word depent of how you perceive it, and how your brain cells interacts and connect the datas to your present knowledge. <br>


<br><br> Breaking news ; your brain captures knowledge to create ideas and it will always level up. As you will.

<br><br>You did everything precisely to arrive at this situation.<br>

<br><br><button class="collapsible-blk">- Dependance -</button>
<div class="content-blk">
<p>We have all experienced this immense loneliness, where everything - books, religion, everything - slips away,<br>
and where we are, deep within us,<br>
immensely alone and empty.<br>
<br>
We are usually unable to face this emptiness,<br>
This loneliness, <br>
and we run away from it.<br>
<br>
Dependance is one of the things in which we find refuge, soon to be indispensable, because we can't bear to be alone with ourselves.<br></p></div>

<br><br><button class="collapsible-blk">- Independance -</button>
<div class="content-blk">
<p>We are one. In the loneliness, you find unity. You coexist with your own, there is everything in your sight. You know your knowledge.<br>
Thoughts are only the reflection of connexions in your brain.<br>
As your blood it just flows in your veins.<br>
Things are in correct line, following logical course.<br>
<br>
We are facing our own existence, right now.<br>
And for all our time alive here.<br>
<br>
Independance is a pathway which the influence of the external world seems absent. Nothing can make you slips from your way of thinking.<br></p></div>

<!--<br><br><button class="collapsible-blk">Do we suffer when we die ?</button>
<div class="content-blk">
<p>For some reason, I keep asking myself this question. It keeps me awake at night. My brain can visualise such awful shapes, weird faces, disturbing things. it's been 3 or 4 days I didn't properly eat, my head HURTS and my super wonderful roommate put a hammer near my head to joke. Hilarious guy.<br>I've been sick. Severely affected by this. My body just can't stand up and i just suffer and suffer days after days. Ignoring friends, family messages. Isolating myself and dreaming about my own death. I arrived at a point when I stab myself because i was hungry and my brain didn't block the pain like it should. Agonising all night. I am sorry. if you read this. These are just... pathetic complainings. I'll try to recover I promise, if i don't die. I'll try to think about this. And apologize</p>

<div class="content-blk">
<p>Does it hurt when you die ?<br>
How long it takes for your brain to fully disconnect from your body ? I am sure and certain that no one dies right on the spot.<br>
The brain has to register the information before it leaves you immobile forever.<br>
It has to take the fact that your muscles are crushed, dismembered, burst on the ground.<br>
I start to <i>fear</i> it. Not death actually ; <i>pain</i>.<br>
The hours of unexpected and intensive suffering until the last breath.<br>
'Don't be <bold>that</bold> scared too, ok ?)<br>
Don't be badly influenced by these words and don't overthink about it.<br>
Suffering is the proof of living.<br>
You're alive now. This world is calling your energy.<br>
To tap into your knowledge and then engulf it all in the deep hole of forgotten memories.<br>

<br>But even if you have fears ; some things are inevitable and you just have to accept it.<br>
<br><br>
Be brave.<br>
Don't inject this poison into your veins.

People's mind transcend actual reality or time. <i>This is the underground scene.</i><br>The thing with these community of people who is living apart from society is their ability to reunite spirits together, it's absolutely sick to see the power of decibels ; music actually interest people, it reunites them. You can understand a song, a music. But not the whole human or humanity.

What appears to a surface, under the light spot is what only perception can see. The core, the very truth of something is the shadow of the object.

Depression hits a lot of us, overthinking can be bad for your mind. But it's only because you shaped it to destroy yourself that it hurts.<br>Write over your feelings. Be careful with your acts. But there's no need to filter your thoughts. Your mind can go anywhere, and can make you travel without moving your cagebone. That's a power of being able to think.

"I'm really sleep deprived"
This being exuded a feeling of softness, of life.
The white petals detached noiselessly in the light spring wind.
Behind me, the cars were speeding along, rushing through the static atmosphere. The air smelled of pollution.
It was gray, the clouds became more and more dense. The humidity was approaching, it was going to rain soon."

"I woke up. That night.<br>
The dreams I had was powerful, almost real.<br>When you dream of a Universe close to reality, it sometimes means a lot to your actual actions.<br> Ok, sometimes it can be absolutely nonsense, a pile of absurd thoughts.<br>But your brain is able to create them. <i>These thoughts.</i><br>
Oneiromancy is the art of divination through dreams. To understand better the human used to work with symbolics and similarity. Have you ever dream that you lose your teeth ? It's a recurrent dream, it seems. I'm not really into limit my thoughts by the words of other humans, each person has their own free will and their own interpretation.<br>
What I find interesting is :
The dreams can open another dimension, an illusion of your reality.<br> And you absolutely are free to imagine everything you want.<br> There's different levels of sleep. The dream is a way to free oneself from the ordinary world, time and space. The illusion can be very strong sometimes and take you away in a very comfortable reality.<br> Insomnia is the opposite.<br>
The fact with illusions is that you should separate imagination with reality. Or for your best mental stability, you have to remember who you are, who you <i>were</i> Things can be very fast, and you can be lost sometimes. <i>Remain yourself.</i><br><br>Don't go too far, stay who you are."

- Vagrancy & rituals -
</button>
<div class="content-blk">
<!--Reading a book named " Le Maître des illusions / Secret History "<br>
It's a history about university students in a school that are influenced by European rituals and push their limits in experiences.<br>
The book lets you meet different characters : Richard Papen, Francis A., Henry, the twins Camilla & Charles, Bunny / Edmond. The main characters have interactions between them and we follow them through their perceptions of life. <br>
The story takes place in a university. The main character is an observer.<br>
The book leads to meeting the extremes of group experiences, excesses, orgies waltzing between good and evil.<br>
Each characters has their own characteristics and struggles.<br>
<br>
I admire the work of the writer ; the colours of the atmosphere is dull, morbid. Sometimes bright and give hope. Sometimes very cold. Sometimes very fast. Sometimes violent. Sometimes it's just... slice of life of young adults. Vices.<br>-->
<br>
The thing about pushing your limits is the experience of losing control. There are many ways to lose control ; but how far can we go ?<br>
We can experience things, but irreversible things can not be hided. Your actions have deep consequences<br>
The ritual is a set of actions, words and objects, codified based on the belief in efficiency and appropriate to specific situations of existence.<br>Humans are too easily influenced.<br><i>How can we believe in anything ?</i><br>

The Earth operates under a system.<br>
We can represent the cycle of life as a circle.<br>
When someone decides to interrupt the cycle, <i>frustration</i> arises.<br>
<br>
In the middle of a conversation, someone said : "Sometimes it's better to act "bestially" than to let frustration take hold. Because it can lead to greater misfortune. Which in the end represses the original nature. "<br>

There's no differents between us, and we are all different ; in the same time. We are all the same but differently ; in our way. The path we left on the earth<br>

When you start to live, you don't really have the precisely idea of the the meaning of existence ; you capture the emotions around you, the present moments. The causes without thinking of the consequences.<br>
When you grow up, you understand things better. Order and harmony. The balance of the essential.<br>
You push your body to the limits of its physical and mental capacity, to experience the building and the self-destruction ; you just actually live.<br>

- Systems of linguistic & communication -

<div class="content-blk">
Any language is a system where everything is connected, or better, a system of systems, in which certain parts are closely independent or relatively independent.<br>To isolate any sign for methodological purposes, supposes an awareness of the idea of the structured system in its vivid and effective reality.<br> 
Language is a complex phenomenon, just like the human able to communicate with words.<br>
Much thought can escape; the message can even remain an interior language, elaboration of a personal thought, which will become clear by articulating itself in expressive form. <br>
The personal expression of one's thoughts and the development that every human persists in cultivating is a set of values as a cultural process according to a social reality.<br>
Language is essential to be understood. From then on a thought is born in the individual, then the concept of language is inevitably linked to the definition of human person and reflects its fundamental properties.<br>

* Semantic : branch of linguistics that studies signifieds; what can be conveyed by statements, a process contributing to the construction of meaning in communication.<br>

Small talks can become reassuring sometimes. And sometimes regrettable.<br>

- Making choices -
</button>
<div class="content-blk">
From an early age, you are faced to make choices.<br>
When a problem arises, we look for a solution.<br>
What if we can't decide ?<br>
<br>
Preferences are developped in us when we interact with the outside world. The influence, the taste of the people we consider close friends, the environment has an impact on the decisions we make and will make later.
<br>
Deciding, making a choice defines a personality trait on the present. It's the same when you speak out loud, the words you use will define the person you are in the present time. There's 2 languages : personal language and manifest language.<br>
The personal language is your thoughts.<br>
And the manifest langage is what you communicate to others.<br>
<br>
There's no good of bad choices.<br>Only the path choosen is different.<br>
<br>
Not being able to make a choice can be complicated when there's an urge (time concept), or when others human beings are included - maybe you have difficulties, because you don't know where to place yourself, in general ? -<br>
Being in front of a situation you never faced before has an effect on your curiosity. The human being is trying to understand, to connect to what they want to understand when they're around  phenomenons.

Time concept create the fact that the human has to find its own space, the universe is constantly expanding.<br>

We sincerely, naively dream of being loved.<br>
That's what we believe. Innocently.<br>
Maybe in reality, we dream of being preferred ?<br>
Liked, yes, but a little more than the others.<br><br>

We drown our despair in the eyes of others. In our personal beliefs, we drown.<br>

But what if we were really alone ?<br> Lonely souls.

True love has no preferences.<br>
Love is patient, is full of kindness.<br>
Love is not envious, love does not boast, it is not puffed up. 
It is neither dishonest nor interested.<br>
It does not get angry, and does not suspect evil.<br>
It does not rejoice in injustice, but rejoices in the truth.<br>
Perfection only exists in the world of ideas.<br>
<br>
Something passes through beyond preconceived ideas, towards a raw love, a simple love.<br>
We should be content with what we have. We should not to ask too much.<br>

<p>
There are 7.7 billion people on earth.<br>
We inevitably coexist with humans.<br> We live with them, we have divergent cultures and thoughts.<br>
Different stories, different pasts.<br> 
We are all the same, differently. And also each human has their own authenticity and singularity.<br>No need to say that, finding our own place in this ever-expanding universe is not an easy thing.<br>
Sometimes, you are lucky. Sometimes you're not.<br>
<br>
You could interact with people.<br>It's a possibility.<br>
But you also can decide how.<br> Interactions is a game with multiple possibilities. As life is.<br>
You choose the path you want, the character you are.<br>
This is more complex, of course.<br>

This is not ' just a game '. Because if you hit the ' game over '. It's truly over.<br>
You can fuck everything up with an action.<br>
There is no ' ctrl z '...
Be careful.<br>

<br>
People tend to interact between them. They never stopped to wish for a better world.<br>
For something to believe in.<br>
For hope.<br>
They never stop talking and talking<br>
Chaining words on words, ideas on ideas,<br>
Thus vacillates the spirit of our generations.<br>
Everything is going so fast<br>

The influence changes people.
The influence of one person on another disrupts a person's fundamental thoughts ;<br>
It's like being carried away by the wind, by a waltz of notes, following the mass.<br>
You're not thinking by yourself.<br>
This is not a bad thing. To try to understant how the world is functionning, to perceive the perspectives of other's soul.<br>
But when is the time when you're not thinking by yourself ? Who were you before all the influences ?<br>
We are all growing up, developing new ideas, or keeping yourself from the world falling appart.<br>
Try to remember.<br>
To not go that far.<br>
To stay yourself.<br>

<br><br><button class="collapsible-blk">* Dependance *
</button>
<div class="content-blk"><br>
Recently, I freed myself from a dependency that was taking away my freedom. Upon regaining this freedom, I felt lost. For too long, I clung to this comfort without spreading my own wings. The life I lead may not seem very useful in the eyes of society, and I fear being considered a parasite. I am indeed lost, and I cannot find the light, so I retreat into the shadow of what I have always known: the past, nostalgia, and inaction.<br><br>
</div>

<br><br><button class="collapsible-blk">* Nostalgia *
</button>
<div class="content-blk"><br>
Nostalgia is a complex and powerful emotional experience that involves a longing or affectionate remembrance of the past. It is a sentimental yearning for moments, experiences, places, or people from a previous time in one's life. The term "nostalgia" is derived from two Greek words: "nostos," which means "return home," and "algos," which means "pain" or "ache." Thus, nostalgia can be thought of as a bittersweet feeling of longing for a time or place that has passed and cannot be fully recaptured.<br><br>

<br><br><button class="collapsible-blk">* Ruin of Humanity *
</button>
<div class="content-blk"><br>
The "ruin of humanity" refers to a state or condition in which the fundamental values, principles, and qualities that define human civilization and society have been severely damaged or lost. It implies a significant decline or degradation in the moral, social, and cultural fabric of humanity. Explaining the ruin of humanity involves understanding the various factors that can contribute to this decline:<br>
<br>
- Moral Decay : When ethical standards erode and principles of compassion, empathy, and integrity are disregarded, it can lead to a sense of moral decay. Actions driven by selfishness, greed, and lack of empathy can contribute to the ruin of humanity's ethical foundation.<br>
<br>
- Conflict and Violence: Widespread conflicts, wars, and violence among individuals, communities, or nations can cause immense suffering, destruction, and loss of life. Prolonged conflicts can hinder progress, disrupt societies, and undermine the sense of collective humanity.<br>
<br>
- Environmental Degradation: The reckless exploitation of natural resources, pollution, and climate change pose significant threats to the planet and all living beings. The degradation of the environment can lead to ecological imbalances, affecting human livelihoods and well-being.<br>
<br>
- Social Injustice: When societies perpetuate systemic discrimination, inequality, and marginalization, it can lead to social unrest and division. Injustice denies individuals their basic rights and dignity, corroding the sense of shared humanity.<br>
<br>
- Technological Advancements: While technology can bring positive advancements, it can also be a double-edged sword. Misuse or lack of ethical considerations in technological developments may lead to societal disruptions and loss of human connection.<br>
<br>
- Loss of Empathy and Compassion: A decline in empathy and compassion can lead to a lack of understanding and support for fellow humans, resulting in a sense of detachment and indifference to the suffering of others.<br>
<br>
- Erosion of Cultural Heritage: The loss of cultural diversity, traditions, and knowledge can diminish humanity's rich tapestry of wisdom and collective memory.<br>
<br>
- Polarization and Division: When societies become deeply polarized and divided, it can hinder cooperation, dialogue, and mutual understanding, making it challenging to address common challenges.<br>
<br>
- Global Challenges: Humanity faces numerous global challenges, such as pandemics, poverty, and refugee crises. Failure to address these issues collectively can contribute to the ruin of humanity's ability to address shared problems.<br>
<br>
- Lack of Long-Term Vision: Short-sightedness and a focus on immediate gains without considering the long-term consequences can lead to decisions that undermine the well-being of future generations.<br>
<br>
It is essential to recognize and address these challenges proactively. Solutions to the ruin of humanity often require collective efforts, empathy, and a commitment to fostering a more just, sustainable, and compassionate world. By promoting values such as respect, understanding, and cooperation, humanity can strive to build a better future for all.<br>

</button>
<div class="content-blk"><br>

Being neutral or indifferent can have both positive and negative implications, depending on the context and the reasons behind the neutrality or indifference.<br>
In some situations, neutrality or indifference may be appropriate or even beneficial.<br>
Emotional Protection : Indifference or neutrality can sometimes serve as a defense mechanism to protect oneself from emotional distress, especially in situations where one feels overwhelmed or unable to affect change.<br>
However, there are also potential drawbacks to being consistently neutral or indifferent :<br>
Lack of Engagement : Indifference can lead to a lack of engagement or involvement in important issues, relationships, or activities, which may hinder personal growth, societal progress, or meaningful connections with others.
<br>
Impact on Relationships: Indifference or neutrality in personal relationships can lead to feelings of neglect, isolation, or detachment from others, potentially damaging the quality of relationships over time. <br>

<br><br><button class="collapsible-blk">* Werthérisme *
</button>
<div class="content-blk"><br>
Le "werthérisme" désigne l'attitude ou le comportement inspiré par le personnage de Werther, le protagoniste du roman de Goethe. Le werthérisme se caractérise par une sensibilité exacerbée, une passion amoureuse désespérée, et une vision du monde teintée de mélancolie. Les individus qui adoptent cette attitude se laissent souvent envahir par leurs émotions, vivant de manière intense et parfois tragique leur souffrance amoureuse ou existentielle, à l'instar de Werther. Ce phénomène était particulièrement marqué dans les jeunes générations au moment de la publication de l'œuvre.

Exemple de werthérisme : Un jeune homme ou une jeune femme qui, à la suite d'une rupture amoureuse, se plonge dans une profonde mélancolie, exprime sans cesse son désespoir dans des lettres ou des poèmes, et finit par adopter un comportement excessivement dramatique, voire autodestructeur, imitant la souffrance du personnage de Werther.
